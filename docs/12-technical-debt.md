### TD-001: Dead code cleanup (Resolved 2026-07-03)

- Removed unused `ChatCompletionRequest`, `ChatMessage`, `KeyUpdateQuery` stubs.
- Removed redundant `proxy.rs` auth/handler (replaced by `chat.rs` implementation).
- `TenantAuth` extractor available for future SaaS route enforcement.

## Monitoring Items

| Item | Priority | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| TenantAuth wiring | Low | When SaaS deployments need per-route org enforcement |
| Provider registry in AppState | Low | When chat.rs switches from env-var to registry-based routing |
| Rate limiter in AppState | Low | When TPM/RPM enforcement is enabled on chat endpoints |
